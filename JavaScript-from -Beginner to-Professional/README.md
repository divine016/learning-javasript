Day 5 exercise ![Hurdle Jump](img/day5.png) 
we can combine arrow functions with built in methods.

if we usig the forEach method a common example would be 

```
const arr = ["squirrel", "alpaca", "buddy"];
arr.forEach(e => console.log(e));
```

line 102 in chapter 6 return underfined because our function has nothing to return
if we have just one line in an arrow function that we need to return we may not use the return keyword 
example 
```
let addTwoNumbers = (x, y) => x + y;
let result = addTwoNumbers(12, 15);
console.log(result);
//27
```
but when using multiple line then we would need to inslude the return word

```
let addTwoNumbers = (x, y) => {
console.log("Adding...");
return x + y;
}
```
### What i was able to learn today
* functions
* spread operators
* rest parameters
* arrow functions
* using arrow functions and methods as demonstrated above
