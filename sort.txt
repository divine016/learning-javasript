Explanation of the nonMutatingSort function
TL;DR
The nonMutatingSort function takes an array as an argument, creates a copy of the global array, sorts the copy, and 
returns the sorted copy without modifying the original array.
Explanation
The nonMutatingSort function takes an array as an argument. The function creates a copy of the global array using the 
spread operator ([...globalArray]) and assigns it to the arr variable. The spread operator creates a new array with 
the same elements as the globalArray array, so any changes made to arr will not affect the globalArray array.
The function then sorts the arr array using the sort method. The sort method sorts the elements of an array in 
place and returns the sorted array. The sort method takes a compare function as an optional argument. The compare 
function is used to determine the order of the elements in the sorted array. The compare function takes two arguments, 
a and b, which represent two elements of the array. The compare function returns a negative number if a should 
come before b, a positive number if a should come after b, and 0 if a and b are equal.
In this case, the compare function checks if a is equal to b. If they are equal, the function returns 0. If a is 
less than b, the function returns a negative number, which tells the sort method to put a before b. If a is 
greater than b, the function returns a positive number, which tells the sort method to put a after b.
Finally, the function returns the sorted arr array.
Possible bugs

The globalArray variable is declared outside of the function, which makes it a global variable. This can lead to 
unexpected behavior if the variable is modified by other parts of the code.
The function does not check if the argument passed to it is an array, which can lead to errors if a non-array value is 
passed as an argument.

Possible improvements

Remove the dependency on the global variable by passing the array to be sorted as an argument.
Add input validation to ensure that the argument passed to the function is an array.
