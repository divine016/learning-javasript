Explanation of the filteredList code
TL;DR
The filteredList code filters the watchList array to include only movies with an IMDB rating greater than 8.0, 
and then maps the resulting array to a new array of objects containing only the movie title and rating.
Explanation
The filteredList code uses the filter and map array methods to transform the watchList array into a new array 
of objects containing only the movie title and rating for movies with an IMDB rating greater than 8.0.
The filter method is used to create a new array that includes only the movies with an IMDB rating greater than 8.0. 
The filter method takes a callback function as an argument, which is called for each element in the array. 
The callback function takes the current element as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the 
element should be included in the new array. In this case, the callback function checks if the imdbRating property 
of the current movie is greater than 8.0.
The map method is then used to transform the resulting array into an array of objects containing only the movie 
title and rating. The map method takes a callback function as an argument, which is called for each element in the 
array. The callback function takes the current element as an argument and returns a new value that will be included 
in the new array. In this case, the callback function returns a new object with the title and rating properties 
set to the Title and imdbRating properties of the current movie, respectively.
Finally, the resulting array of objects is logged to the console using console.log.
Possible bugs

There is a typo in the code: imdbRatting should be imdbRating.
The imdbRating property is a string, not a number, so the comparison with 8.0 may not work as expected.
The resulting array of objects does not have a consistent property name for the rating property (ratting vs rating).

Possible improvements

Use the Number function to convert the imdbRating property to a number before comparing it with 8.0.
Use a consistent property name for the rating property in the resulting array of objects.
Sort the resulting array of objects by rating in descending order.
