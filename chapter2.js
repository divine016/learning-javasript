/*the break stetement makes it possible to jump out of the loop
continue is similar to break but when a continue satement is encountered it jumps out of the current executing body and does the next body of iteretion.
if you have a statement that has many if elseif then we can use a switch to represent that.
the code below breaks out of a loop*/
//*current a variable that increments
//*a program that looks for a number that is greater thn 7 and divisible by 7
for(let current = 20; ; current+=1){
    if(current % 7 === 0){
        console.log(current);
        break;
    }
}//output:21

//if elseif statements
if (x == "value1") action1();
elseif (x == "value2") action2();
elseif (x == "value3") action3();
else defaultAction2();
//the syntax of a switch is as follows

switch(prompt("what is the weather like today?")){
    case "rainy":
        console.log("remember to bring your umbrella");
        break;
    case "sunny":
        console.log("Dress lightly");
        break;
    case "cloudy":
        console.log("Go outside");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("unknown weather");
        break;

 When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz"
