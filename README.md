<h1>OK  so initially it was meant for learning js which i am still doing but in the form of #100days of code would change the name of the file soon</h1>
<h2>This file would contain the codes i would write for both alx and my personal learning on javascript(my 100 days of code learning journey)</h2>
<p>I am currently taking the javascript course on @grasshopper and I learning javascript.</p>
<p><h3>Day1</h3> <br> I completed half of the task on @grasshopper and I was able to learn about function calling, variable, if/else statements. </p>
<p><h3>Day2</h3> <br>I was able to finish the first part of the course which the coding fundamentals and i learned about for loops objects, for-in and for-of loops how to access an object and how to store an array as an object property.</p>
<p><h3>Day3</h3> <br>So i started the fundamentals 2 of the grasshopper javascript and i learned about .length , and methods like include and replace and also looked at variable scopes. learned about local and global variables.</p>
<p><h3>Day 4</h3><br> learned a out ternary operators</p>
<p><h3>Day 5</h3><br> console.log and functions
<p><h3>Day 6</h3><br> so i learn about the push pop filter foreach slice  spread operator  and also learned about helper functions parameters and arguments ONE COMPILER</p>
<p><h3>day 7</h3> <br> learned more on functions and indexing</p>
<p><h3>day 8</h3> <br>
learning dom manipulation on w3schools. don't have data on my pc so cant connect to Grasshopper
</p>
<p><h3>day 9</h3> <br>learned about computational thinking, while loops</p>
<p><h3>Day 10</h3><br> I wrote different functions that perform different stuff </p>
<p><h3>Day 11</h3><br> I was able to solve one of google coding interview but i didn't quite understand parts of the code.  <br>
<b>indexOf</b> is used to find the index of the argument passed to the method.  <br> LastIndexOf works like indexOf just that it starts searching from the last element i the array. if ak element is not found the method returns a -1.<br>
<b>shift</b> method remove the first element in an array and its similar to .pop method  <br>
<b>unshift</b> method adds element to the start of an array works like push <br>
<b>.reverse</b> is used to reverse a string  <br>
<b>the splice method is used to replace elements in an array at a certain position in the array. it takes 3 parameters. the start position end position and the elements is going to replace at the specified position.</b>
<b>.join method</b> it is used to combine elements of an array into  string. it takes parameters and adds the parameter as it combines the elements of the array. if no argument is passed it automatically adds a comma(',') <br>
<b>.map</b> it take elements and replace them. <br>
<b>.reduce</b>.reduce() uses an array to calculate a single value, for example the sum.
.reduce() uses 2 arguments: a callback function, and a starting value. The callback also uses 2 parameters: the total value so far, and the current value.
</p>
<p><h3>Day 12</h3> <br>so learned about svg, event handlers
</p>
<p><h3>Day13</h3><br> learned more on animations. how to include loops so as to make complex animation. <br> Also learned about debugging code and learned about the different types of errors. syntax arithmetic and logic errors. <br> Learned about the try ...catch statements</p>
<p><h3>day 14</h3> <br> getElementById is used to select a specific id and returns the element matching the id. <br>
.textContent is used to change the text of a specific id.  the appendChild method is used to add an html element as a  child of another element.</p>
<p><h3>Day 15</h3> <br>I continued to learn how to get element from html using javascript and i also leaarned about the appendChild element. <br> and also about the createElement property. <br>
document.createElelement('') is used to create a new element then you can use the appendChild so as to append the element in the body. <br>
also learned about the addEventListenner. it takes two parameter the taction to perform and also the event.</p>
<p><h3>day 16</h3> <br> so yesterday I went to the css battle page and a friend of mine was teaching me how to solve redo some fun drawings using css and html. </p>
<p><h3>Day 17</h3> <br>learned about automation with appScripts. https://www.google.com/script/start/</p>
<p><h3>Day 18</h3> <br> so for day 18 i worked on an old project which i had build already and im trying to make it more dynamic. Afro Vision </p>
<p><h3>Day 19</h3> <br> still worked on the project.</p>
<p><h3>Day 20</h3> <br>I started back with my freecodecamp course so i learned about functional programming mutations and also the outcome is known as mutation</p>
<p><h3>Dat 21</h3><br>Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. <br> This means if a function depends on a variable or object being present, then pass that variable or object directly into the function as an argument. <br>

There are several good consequences from this principle. The function is easier to test, you know exactly what input it takes, and it won't depend on anything else in your program. </p>
<p><h3>day 22</h3><br>The map method iterates over each item in an array and returns a new array containing the results of calling the callback function on each element. It does this without mutating the original array.
<br>
When the callback is used, it is passed three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. 
<br>
The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the map method was called.</p>
<p><h3>Day 23</h3> <br>here i implemented the map function using a for loop.</p>
<p><h3>day 26, 27,28</h3> <br> Days that i did work. but stiil related to day 25,24,23</p>
<p><h3>day 29</h3> <br> reduce method
//The callback function accepts four arguments. <br> The first argument is known as the accumulator, which gets assigned the return value of the callback function from the previous iteration, the second is the current element being processed, the third is the index of that element and the fourth is the array upon which reduce is called
<br>
//using the reduce method to return the key and value of an obj</p>
<p><h3>day 30</h3> <br> The sort method sorts the elements of an array according to the callback function. A side effect of the sort method is that it changes the order of the elements in the original array. In other words, it mutates the array in place</p>
<p><h3>Day 31</h3> <br>using regular expressions and also the split method to split string in to an array of that string. also did a little revision on regulaer expressions. Also learned about the join method: which  takes an array and combines it to a string.</p>
<p><h3>day 32</h3> <br>Apply Functional Programming to Convert Strings to URL Slugs. Use the every Method to Check that Every Element in an Array Meets a Criteria</p>
<p><h3>day 33</h3> <br>The some method works with arrays to check if any element passes a particular test. It returns a Boolean value - true if any of the values meet the criteria, false if not. Introduction to Currying and Partial Application</p>
<p><h3>Day 34</h3><br>starting the last module and wrote two function today
<ol>
    <li>code that takess two numbers in the array and add upto all the numbers in between them including those two numbers</li>
    <li>code that takes two  arrays and checks if there is any number found in one that is not in the other.</li>
</ol> </p>
<p><h3>Day 35</h3> <br>wrote 3 functions today 
<ol>
    <li>You will be provided with an initial array (the first argument in the destroyer function), followed by one or more arguments. Remove all elements from the initial array that are of the same value as these arguments.</li>
    <li>function that taks two paramters and checks if the objext found in the second argument is found in the first and returns an array containing the lements found in second argument.</li>
    <li>/Convert a string to spinal case. Spinal case is all-lowercase-words-joined-by-dashes.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><h3></h3><br></p>
<p><h3></h3><br></p>
<p><h3></h3><br></p>

<p><h3>Day 39</h3><br>In this solution, we check every multiple of the largest value in the range until we find a value that is divisible by every value in the range.
<br>
The upper bound for this loop is the product of all values in the provided range, because this number will be divisible by every value in the range. didnt understand this code</p>
<p><h3>day 40</h3><br>started with the certification did the roman numeral converter and also workedd on the palindrom checker also wrote  a function to reverse a string</p>
<p><h3>day 41</h3><br>Flatten a nested array. You must account for varying levels of nesting. also wrote a code that  took a certain function as argument and an array if the elements in the array do not meet the function criteria then the elmt in the array should be cutoff starting form the left.</p>
<p><h3>day 42</h3><br> wrote a function that converted from binary to words useful things i learned were split join parseInt and also String.<br><b>fromCharCode<b> also wrote a function that takes an array of object and a property and checks if all the elements in the array that have that property are truthy or not. Create a function that sums two arguments together. <br>If only one argument is provided, then return a function that expects one argument and returns the sum. </p>
<p><h3>day 43</h3> <br>Fill in the object constructor with the following methods below:
<ul>
    <li>getFirstName()</li>
    <li>getLastName()</li>
    <li>getFullName()</li>
    <li>setFirstName(first)</li>
    <li>setLastName(last)</li>
    setFullName(firstAndLast)
</ul>
According to Kepler's Third Law, the orbital period  T of two point masses orbiting each other in a circular or elliptic orbit is:

T=2π√(a**3/μ)
</p>
<p><h3>day 44</h3><br>Did the telephone validator and a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.</p>
<p><h3>day 45</h3><h2><b>BREAK</b></h2></p>
<p><h3></h3></p>
<p><h3></h3></p>
<p><h3></h3></p>
<p><h3>day 49</h3><br>nodeName is read-only
<ul><h3>nodeName is read-only<h3>
<li>nodeName of an element node is the same as the tag name</li>
<li>nodeName of an attribute node is the attribute name</li>
<li>nodeName of a text node is always #text</li>
<li>nodeName of the document node is always #document</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><h3>day 50 51</h3><br> i build an interface that takes in user details and print them out when requested.</p>
<p><h3>day 52</h3><br>"here i made a card that can be used to represent people that implemented glasmorphism. its cool though :)</p>
<p><h3>day 53</h3><br> made a digital clock. the file that has VS at the end represents the clock numbers in two's and the one just there represent the clock numbers in one's</p>
<p><h3>Day 54</h3><br>made a calculator</p>
<p><h3>Day 55</h3><br>started with a music player app did the html and part of the css</p>
<p><h3>day 56</h3><br>ok so i finished the css and started  was really tired so i commented on the html and css of the music player.</p>
<p><h3>day 57</h3><br> ok so now starting with JS for the music player</p>

<p><h3>day 58 and 59</h3><br>its really fun cus i am getting to learn more. like this is the type of project i need to so as to learn</p>
<p><h3>Day60</h3><br>
<h1>HURRAY!!!!!!!! im at two months of coding already now we left with 40 more days </h1>
and i also finished coding my music app its so cool and i played the songs i like :)
</p>
<p><h3>Day61</h3> <br> i started attending an 3day onsite bootcamp on <h2><b>React</b></h2>
<p>we first started with javascript today 15.06.2023</p>
<p>we did the following </p>
 <ul>
    <li>functions and objects  an object is data type that you give it other data types php we see associative arrays.</li>
    <li>we also use the "delete" so as to remove an attribute form an object.</li>
    <li> methods are like variables but they perform an operation</li>
    <li>so the "this" concept is there to tell us we want to access something within the object.</li>
    <li>we also talked abit about APIs API is a way to pull data from another website</li>
</ul>
We can have an object that takes other object like lets say we an have an atribute that takes an object as an</p>
