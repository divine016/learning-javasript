<h2>This file would contain the codes i would write for both alx and my personal learning on javascript</h2>
<p>I am currentl taking the javascript course on @grasshopper and I learning javascript.</p>
<p><h4>Day1</h4> <br> I completed half of the task on @grasshopper and I was able to learn about function calling, variable, if/else statements. </p>
<p><h4>Day2</h4> <br>I was able to finish the first part of the course which the coding fundamentals and i learned about for loops objects, for-in and for-of loops how to access an object and how to store an array as an object property.</p>
<p><h4>Day3</h4> <br>So i started the fundamentals 2 of the grasshopper javascript and i learned about .length , and methods like include and replace and also looked at variable scopes. learned about local and global variables.</p>
<p><h4>Day 4</h4><br> learned a out ternary operators</p>
<p><h4>Day 5</h4><br> console.log and functions
<p><h4>Day 6</h4><br> so i learn about the push pop filter foreach slice  spread operator  and also learned about helper functions parameters and arguments ONE COMPILER</p>
<p><h4>day 7</h4> learned more on functions and indexing</p>
<p><h4>day 8</h4>
learning dom manipulation on w3schools. dont have data on my pc so cant connect to frasshopper
</p>
<p><h4>day 9</h4>learned about computational thinking, while loops</p>
<p><h4>Day 10</h4> I wrote different functions that perform differennt stuff </p>
<p><h4>Day 11</h4> I was able to solve one of google coding interview but i didn't quite understand parts of the code.  <br>
<b>indexOf</b> is used to find the index of the argument passed to the method.  <br> LastIndexOf works like indexOf just that it starts searching from the last element i the array. if ak element is not found the method returns a -1.<br>
<b>shift</b> method remove the first element in an array and its similar to .pop method  <br>
<b>unshift</b> method adds element to the start of an array works like push <br>
<b>.reverse</b> is used to reverse a string  <br>
<b>the splice method is used to replace elements in an array at a certain position in the array. it takes 3 parameters. the start position end position and the elements is going to rplace at the specified position.</b>
<b>.join method</b> it is used to combine elements of an array into  string. it takes parameters and adds the parameter as it combines the elemts of the array. if no argument is passed it automatically adds a comma(',') <br>
<b>.map</b> it take elements and replace them. <br>
<b>.reduce</b>.reduce() uses an array to calculate a single value, for example the sum.
.reduce() uses 2 arguments: a callback function, and a starting value. The callback also uses 2 parameters: the total value so far, and the current value.
</p>
<p><h4>Day 12</h4> so learned about svg, event handlers
</p>
<p><h4>Day13</h4> learned more on animations. how to include loops so as to make complex animation. <br> Also learned about debugging code and learned about the different types of errors. syntasx arithmetic and logic errors. learned anout the try...catch statements</p>
<p><h4>day 14</h4> getElementById is used to select a specific id and returns the element matching the id. 
.textContent is used to change the text of a specific id.  the appendChild method is used to add an html element as a  child of another element.</p>
<p><h4>Day 15</h4>I continued to learn how to get element fron html using javascript and i also leaarned about the appendChild element. and also about the createElement ptoperty.
document.createElelement('') is used to create a new element then you can use the appendChild so as to append the element in the body.
also learned about the addEventListenner. it takes two parameter the taction to perform and also the event.</p>
<p><h4>day 16</h4> so yesterday I went to the css battle page and a friend of mine was teaching me how to solve redo some fun drawings using css and html. </p>
<p><h4>Day 17</h4>learned about automation with appScripts. https://www.google.com/script/start/</p>
<p><h4>Day 18</h4> so for day 18 i worked on an old project which i had build already and im trying to make it more dynamic.</p>
<p><h4>Day 19</h4> still worked on the project.</p>
<p><h4>Day 20</h4>i started back with my freecodecamp course so i learned about functional programming mutations and also the outcome is known as mutation</p>
<p><h4>Dat 21</h4>Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. This means if a function depends on a variable or object being present, then pass that variable or object directly into the function as an argument.

There are several good consequences from this principle. The function is easier to test, you know exactly what input it takes, and it won't depend on anything else in your program. </p>
<p><h4>day 22</h4>The map method iterates over each item in an array and returns a new array containing the results of calling the callback function on each element. It does this without mutating the original array.

When the callback is used, it is passed three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the map method was called.</p>
<p><h4>Day 23</h4>here i implemented the map function using a for loop.</p>
